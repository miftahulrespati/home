    <>
      Hi there! Welcome to my portfolio.
      <br />
      <br />
      I enjoy taking on challenging problems; nothing is more satisfying than
      seeing a project come together flawlessly. Although I cannot promise that
      every line of code I write will be bug-free, I will put in countless hours
      of hard work to ensure my code is as clean and efficient as possible.
      <br />
      <br />
      When I am not busy coding, I love cooking and hanging out with my cats.
